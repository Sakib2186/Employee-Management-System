If during logging in the program says "File Not Found", 
try again. Should work next time.

**********SYSTEM REQUIREMENT**********

Windows 7 or later
Memory- atleast 4GB

JDK-8 or later

if you run on eclipse might need version,
->java.runtime.version=18.0.1.1+2-6

***********THINGS TO KNOW*************
1)

You can find the login information file, admin information file and employee
information file in file directory,

EMS/e3/Datas

2)

To log into the application as admin just choose one of the ID from the 
LoginInfo.txt. The password would be the immediate next word after the ID you chose.

If you choose an ID ending with 630, then it is of an Admin and you would interract as an 
Admin as well.

If you choose an ID ending with 128, then it is of an Employee and you would interract as an
Employee.

3)

ID must be of 8 digits. So when you are registering a new Admin or a new Employee into the system, be 
sure to make the ID 8 digits including the last three necessary digits.

For adding new admin, you have to manually give the last three digits as 630 and for adding new
employee you have to manually give the last three digits as 128.


4)

When you are adding the First and Last name for both the Employee and the Admin, be sure
to write them as a single word.
Example,
First Name: Sakib  
Last Name: Sami

Don't do:
First Name: Siam Ul 
Last Name: Alam

If you need to give a long First Name or Last Name, enter name like
First Name: Siam-Ul
Last Name: Alam

just use hyphen 

5) 

When you are adding the address of an Employee, don't give any space between consecutive words,
rather separate them with commas.

Example: House-190,Road-20,Block-C,Pallabi,Mirpur,Dhaka,Bangladesh
